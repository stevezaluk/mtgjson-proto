Deck - Represents an MTGJSON deck

See here for more info: https://mtgjson.com/data-models/deck

This model has been changed slightly from the original model to seperate out lists for
both the card ids and for cards themselves. This way we can store just the ID's in the database
and fill the contents field before it gets returned to the user
